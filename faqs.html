              <p>We recommend booking 2-4 weeks in advance, especially during busy seasons (spring and fall). However, we can often accommodate urgent projects depending on our current schedule. For larger projects requiring permits, allow additional time for permit approval which can take 2-4 weeks depending on the municipality.</p>

              <p>Interior renovations can be done year-round. Exterior work (hardscaping, roofing, siding) is best done spring through fall (April-October).

            <div class="faq__answer">
              <p>While possible, we typically don't recommend it. Our supplier relationships allow us to get contractor pricing and priority delivery. We also can't warranty materials we don't supply. If you prefer to supply specific items (fixtures, appliances), we can accommodate this but require coordination to ensure proper specifications and timing.</p>
